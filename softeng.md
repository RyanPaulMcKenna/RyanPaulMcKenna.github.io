subtitle: My software engineering notes
---


Reference of all computer science fundamentals with examples.

specific areas:
    - fundamentals like:
            boolean algebra, predicates, algorithms, data-structures, object-orientated, functional, architecture, networking, SOLID, refactoring,
            test-driven, behavior-driven, project-management
    - how libraries, frameworks, APIs, SDKs and application(s) are built:
        focus on how the architecture and networking and programming language type (statically types vs dynamically types, garbage collection, level; low, high) differ between these types of software.
    - language specifics
        c++, Python

start from the top, be minmalistic, clean and fast, this should not take long.

How-to-dos in : (As these develop, they can become articles and then be moved off into the posts section, so then we have work flow of notes become posts)
    CUDA, scientific computing, high-performance computing, embedded development, robotics (software eng perspective), simulations,
