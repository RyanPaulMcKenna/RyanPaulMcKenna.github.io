Again all your written notes should be repeated here, including practice problems. Then lead into minimal but high quality implementations in
gym environments but make them very interesting and make them your own, build the environments yourself with the detailed mathematical descriptions.
Do it once and then it can be re-hased for different examples with minimal effort.
